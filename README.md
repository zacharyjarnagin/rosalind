### About
>Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology. <br>
>... <br>
Mission statement: We hope that Rosalind will inspire a new generation of bioinformatics students by attracting biologists who want to develop vital programming skills at their own pace in a unique environment as well as programmers who have never been exposed to some of the stimulating computational problems generated by molecular biology.

### My Goal
The purpose of this repo is to keep track of my progress through the Rosalind Bioinformatics course. As I solve each exercise in Python 3 with the PyCharm IDE, I will be updating this repository with Git VCS on a Ubuntu subsystem on my Windows 10 OS. As I complete each exercise, I aim to achieve a better understanding of the growing field of bioinformatics, as well as biology, Python, and computer science.
